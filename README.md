#Intro
This is a simple app that simulates TOEFL speaking task1~2. You can record you voice and replay it. Questions are based on real TOEFL exams.
 
 "start" to start recording,
 "stop" to stop recording.
 "play (triangle icon)" to play last recording.
 "45/60 sec" to shift speaking time.

 p.s it is just my first android app. I may update it one day.
